This is a circular Masque skin meant to match the actionbars found in [AzeriteUI](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/azeriteui). It is compatible with Bartender and Bagnon (with Bagnon Facade) and any other addon supporting Masque.

*Note that this is a LARGE skin, meaning it requires a high amount of padding between buttons. In the screenshot we've used Bartender's maximum of 20 points in padding.*
